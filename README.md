# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

This repository contains my Python solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) event. The primary goal is to enhance my coding skills while having a bit of competitive fun.

## Structure

Each day's puzzle solution is in a separate directory named `dayXX`, where `XX` is the day number. Each directory contains a Python script for the solution and an input file.

## Running the Solutions

To execute a solution, navigate to its directory and run the Python script with the input file as an argument:

```bash
python solution.py input.txt
